# Clean Code by Martin Robert C.
Summarized by Thiramate A.

## Intro

You're reading this book for two reasons. First, you are a programmer. Second, you want to be a **better** programmer. We are going to look at code from every different direction. We'll be able to tell the difference between good code and bad code. We’ll know how to write good code. And we’ll know how to transform bad code into good code.

## Chapter 1 - Clean Code

### Bad Code

There was a company, in the late 80s, wrote a _killer_ app. It was very popular and used by lots of professionals. Time fly, load times grew up and crashes increased. Bugs were not repaired from one release to the next. This happended because they had rushed the product to market and had made a huge mess in the code. They keep added more and more features, the code get worse and worse until they cannot manage it any longer. _It was the bad code that brought the company down._

Why did you write bad code? Maybe because you are in rush or trying to go fast. Perhaps you felt you didn't have time to do a good job as your boss would be angry with you if you delay the delivery because you clean up your code. Perhaps you were so tired of working on this program and wanted it to be over. Or even you looked at the backlog and saw a lot of stuff that you had promised to get them done so you need to bang this task fast so you can move on to the next.

We have all felt to seeing messy and unreliable program work and thinking that working mess is better than nothing. We have all said that we will go back and clean it up later. Oh yes, we never know when.
