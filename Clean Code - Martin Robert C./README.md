# Clean Code by Martin Robert C.
Summarized by Thiramate A.

## Intro

You're reading this book for two reasons. First, you are a programmer. Second, you want to be a **better** programmer. We are going to look at code from every different direction. We'll be able to tell the difference between good code and bad code. We’ll know how to write good code. And we’ll know how to transform bad code into good code.

## Chapter 1 - Clean Code

### Bad Code

There was a company, in the late 80s, wrote a _killer_ app. It was very popular and used by lots of professionals. Time fly, load times grew up and crashes increased. Bugs were not repaired from one release to the next. This happended because they had rushed the product to market and had made a huge mess in the code. They keep added more and more features, the code get worse and worse until they cannot manage it any longer. _It was the bad code that brought the company down._

Why did you write bad code? Maybe because you are in rush or trying to go fast. Perhaps you felt you didn't have time to do a good job as your boss would be angry with you if you delay the delivery because you clean up your code. Perhaps you were so tired of working on this program and wanted it to be over. Or even you looked at the backlog and saw a lot of stuff that you had promised to get them done so you need to bang this task fast so you can move on to the next.

We have all felt to seeing messy and unreliable program work and thinking that working mess is better than nothing. We have all said that we will go back and clean it up later. Oh yes, we never know when.

### The Total Cost of Owning a Mess

If you have been working as a programmer for longer than a few years, you have probably been slowed down by messy code. Every change you make always breaks some part of the code. Then you need to twist in order to add something new or modify existing code. By doing that knots can be added. Overtime the mess becomes bigger and deeper until no way to clean it up.

The more mess builds the less team productivity. As productivity decrease, management can do only thing which adds more staff to the project and hopes the productivity will be increased. That not gonna help much as new staffs need time to understand the design of the system. Maybe they need the explanation from existing staffs while they are under horrific pressure to increase productivity. So they all make more and more messes.
